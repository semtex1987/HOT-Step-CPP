# HOT-Step CPP

A desktop app for local AI music generation, built on [acestep.cpp](https://github.com/ServeurpersoCom/acestep.cpp) and GGML. Describe a song with a style caption and lyrics and get stereo audio back, generated entirely on your own hardware with no cloud, API keys or subscription. Three music models run natively in the C++ engine and switch from the toolbar: **ACE-Step 1.5**, **MiniMax-Music3** and **YuE2**.

> ### Training Studio (experimental, but it works)
> Train style adapters for all three models inside the app, with no Python and no external tools. Point it at a folder of songs and it runs the whole pipeline: dataset labelling (local BPM/key analysis, lyrics, and AI captions from a model running on your machine), preprocessing, then native C++/GGML training on your GPU. YuE2 adds a Joint Training method that trains its AR and NAR adapters in one run. Training against a quantized base brings the MiniMax-Music3 VRAM floor from 31.4 GB down to about 10 GB. Runs pause, resume, survive a restart and render an audio preview at every checkpoint.

> Still rough in places and GPU-hungry. Find it in the sidebar as **Training**, and read [Training Studio](docs/user/studios/training-studio.md) first.

## Download

Portable releases, no installation needed: extract and run. Node.js is bundled.

**[Download the latest release](https://github.com/scragnog/HOT-Step-CPP/releases/latest)**

| Platform | Variants |
|---|---|
| **Windows** (x64) | CUDA (NVIDIA), Vulkan (AMD/Intel/NVIDIA), CPU |
| **Linux** (x64) | CUDA (NVIDIA), Vulkan (AMD/Intel/NVIDIA), ROCm (AMD), CPU |
| **macOS** (Apple Silicon) | Metal |

Use CUDA on an NVIDIA card, Vulkan on AMD or Intel, and CPU only if there is no usable GPU, since it is much slower. There are several CUDA builds for different card generations; [Getting started](docs/user/getting-started.md#pick-a-download) has the table that says which file to take.

### Quick start

1. Download the archive for your platform and GPU, and extract it into a folder of its own.
2. Run `HOT-Step.bat` on Windows, or `./HOT-Step.sh` from a terminal on Linux and macOS.
3. Your browser opens at `http://localhost:3001`. Leave the console window open; closing it stops the app.
4. The Model Manager opens on first launch. Download the **Quick Start** pack from the ACE-Step 1.5 tab (about 9 GB), then click **Restart** in the sidebar.
5. Write a style description and lyrics in **Custom-Gen** and click **Generate**. The full walkthrough is in [Getting started](docs/user/getting-started.md).

## Highlights

- **Three music models, one app.** ACE-Step 1.5, MiniMax-Music3 and YuE2 run in the same engine process. The backend picker in the global bar appears whenever two or more backends are registered, and the bar hides controls that do nothing on the active model. See [Backends](docs/user/backends.md).
- **Training Studio.** Style adapters for every backend, trained on your own GPU. See [Training Studio](docs/user/studios/training-studio.md).
- **Auto-Gen and Custom-Gen.** Pick a genre and let the language model write the caption, lyrics and title, or set every field yourself. See [Auto-Gen](docs/user/studios/insta-gen.md) and [Custom-Gen](docs/user/studios/create.md).
- **Lyric Studio.** A lyrics workspace with artist profiles, several LLM providers, bulk generation and the same generation controls as Custom-Gen. See [Lyric Studio](docs/user/studios/lyric-studio.md).
- **Cover and Repaint.** Make style-matched covers of a reference track, or regenerate one region of a song and keep the rest (ACE-Step 1.5). See [Cover Studio](docs/user/studios/cover-studio.md) and [Repaint Studio](docs/user/studios/repaint-studio.md).
- **Stem separation.** BS-RoFormer, Mel-Band RoFormer, MDX23C and Leap Xe running in native GGML, with a mixer and ZIP export. See [Stem Separator](docs/user/studios/stem-studio.md).
- **MIDI Studio.** Audio-to-MIDI transcription on a native GGML port of MuScriptor, with a live piano roll and playback. See [MIDI Studio](docs/user/studios/midi-studio.md).
- **Lua plugins.** Solvers, schedulers, guidance modes and postprocess steps are Lua files: drop one into `engine/plugins/` and it appears in the UI at the next launch, no rebuild. See [Plugins](docs/user/plugins.md) and [Plugin authoring](docs/dev/plugins-authoring.md).
- **LoRA and LoKr adapters.** Merge or runtime mode, per-group strengths, stacking, and per-section masking from the lyrics. See [Adapters](docs/user/adapters.md).
- **Post-processing chain.** Mastering against a reference track, a VST3 host, StableStep refinement through Stable Audio 3, PP-VAE and denoising. See [Generation](docs/user/generation.md#post-processing).
- **Model Manager.** Starter packs and every model file, downloaded in the app with resumable progress, including importance-matrix quants that keep the small sizes usable. See [Model Manager](docs/user/studios/model-manager.md) and [Model files](docs/user/models.md).

The full list, one line per feature, is in [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md).

## Gallery

## Building from source

For GPU hosting, see the [RunPod Pod template guide](docs/dev/runpod.md).

Most people should use a [release](#download). To build it yourself, including the engine, the dev loop and portable packaging, follow [Building from source](docs/dev/building.md).

## Troubleshooting

Every session writes its logs to a new folder under `logs/` next to the launcher: `node_console.log`, `ace_engine.log`, and one `gen_*.log` per generation.
[Troubleshooting](docs/user/troubleshooting.md) covers the common failures (no models found, out of VRAM, GPU not used, macOS blocking the app) and what to attach to an issue.
Questions rather than bugs go to the [Discord](https://discord.gg/ezVtmg9GKX).

## License

HOT-Step CPP is released under the MIT License. See [LICENSE](LICENSE).

Some parts carry their own terms:

- **`engine/`** is MIT, copyright the acestep.cpp authors. See [engine/LICENSE](engine/LICENSE).
- **MDMAchine's plugins** (most of the `md_*` files under `plugins/`, and `storm_sampler_core.lua`) are GPLv3. Each one says so in its header, and the header decides. Releases ship them as source alongside the MIT code, so a release as a whole must meet the GPLv3's terms. The rest of the code remains MIT.
- **Model weights** are not covered by this licence. Each model is under its own terms, listed in the credits above.

Contributions are accepted under the repository licence (MIT) unless a file says otherwise.

## Acknowledgments

- **Alexander Allan ([MDMAchine](https://github.com/MDMAchine))**, for ongoing and generous contributions: the STORM solver and MD Audio Tiled Core postprocess plugins, the real-time VST3 monitoring UX (chain presets, live monitor transport, pause/resume/restart), and a run of JUCE VST3 hosting crash fixes in the engine. This project is better for it.
- **AI-Toolkit**: inspiration for HOT-Step's YuE2 Joint Training method.
- **MotherSuperior** (kytr.ai, [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Mothersuperior)): the original YuE2 encoder that turns songs into the codes the YuE2 trainers learn from.

### The MiniMax-Music3 encoder effort

MiniMax released MiniMax-Music3's weights but not its audio encoder, the piece that turns audio into the RVQ codes the model is trained on. Without one, nobody outside MiniMax could build a training set or train an adapter. A group in the Discord reconstructed it in the open, and HOT-Step's MM3 training exists because they did.

- **[bghira](https://huggingface.co/bghira)** designed the encoder architecture everyone else built on, and published the first working open encoder along with the corpus to train it.
- **[PurpleOrc](https://huggingface.co/PurpleOrc)** trained that architecture from scratch on a 53,000-track corpus built with a deliberate push on non-English lyrics, producing the encoder that took the crown and held it.
- **[Mothersuperior](https://huggingface.co/Mothersuperior)** (kytr.ai) generated distillation corpora on rented L40S fleets, pooled them with everyone else's, and published the pooled encoders back to the group.
- **[Serveurperso](https://huggingface.co/ServeurpersoCom)** contributed a pilot corpus and hidden-state encoders, and measured the real ceiling: decoding from the exact teacher hidden state scores 0.9326, so the semantic top-1 wall everyone kept hitting was the teacher's own sampling entropy, not something more data could train past. That saved the group a lot of wasted compute.
- **testerf**, **redsitouwu** and **afkaf** ran evaluations, argued the metrics into shape, and caught the trap that cross-entropy measures plausibility to the frozen LM rather than fidelity to the audio. That is why the group's gate became CE as a sanity floor, code diversity as an alarm, and a listening test as the verdict.

Thank you, all of you. It was collaborative reverse engineering done in the open, and it unlocked a feature this project could not have shipped alone.
